The Nucleus Angular SASS Framework is a SASS framework that is disigned as a start point for use with the Nucleus Angular components.  While this is designed to be used with the Nucleus Angular compoenents, it can be used on it's own.  Some of the key point are:

- Uses a slightly modified version of Normalize.css as it based
- A minimalist framework that provides the basic building blocks (but for example doesn't deal with layout at all)
- It has a flat UI (you won't see shadows, gradients, etc...) however it would be easy enough for you to add that your if you wanted
- Should look good on desktop and mobile
- Works with FireFox, Chrome, iOS, Android, and IE 11+

IE 11+ means that this framework is only intended/tested on IE 11+.  It is possible that it might work on IE 10 or 9 but it is not tested and any issue on those browsers will not be fixed
